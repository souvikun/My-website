    I had spent most of my life cycling, and part of it by walking. Even a small town like mine seem a lot bigger
when you go slow. Perhaps, What I mean is that for humans value equals how unattainable something is. In fact
distance is directly proportional to it's value, the further something is, the more valuable it becomes. 
</p>
<p>
    I say this because recently travelling with a motorbike has become very common for me, and somewhere in my mind
    my small town has only began to grow smaller and smaller. Imagine it as the opposite of the expanding universe,
    the world is shrinking. It reminds of a old song, one of my favourites since childhood, <a href="https://youtu.
be/TLoICmZ44gw?si=sD97szao_nrCrwPr"><b>Prithibi ta naki choto hotey hotey</b></a>,Perhaps
    I will upload the song below. You might as well listen to it while reading.

        We will continue
